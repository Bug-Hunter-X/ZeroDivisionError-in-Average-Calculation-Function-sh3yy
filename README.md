This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: handling division by zero. The `bug.py` file contains a function that calculates the average of a list of numbers.  However, it doesn't correctly handle the case where the input list is empty, leading to a `ZeroDivisionError`.  The solution, provided in `bugSolution.py`, addresses this by explicitly checking for an empty list and returning 0 in that scenario.
